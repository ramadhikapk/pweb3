This repo is created for the 3rd web programming assignment.
 
'Book review' in this repo is not completed yet, because there is a few bugs that are still undergo for fix.
The implementation of Django in this project is completed, but for the model view controller has not done. 
I try many solutions on the internet, but it seems it did not work very well for me.

I will keep an eye to this project, for this assignment and try to solve the issues.
Thank you very much for your attention.
